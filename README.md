## Exploring and evaluating different Machine Learning Algorithms for Breast Cancer Data

In this project I evaluate the use several common machine learning algorithms to classify tumors as malignant or benign, using data from [Breast Cancer Wisconson] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) dataset. I also explore different feature extraction techniques and combine them with various ML methods to obtain the highest possible accuracy. 

The dataset consists of ten real-valued features obtained from images of fine needle aspirate of breast mass :
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
c) perimeter 
d) area 
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
i) symmetry 
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
